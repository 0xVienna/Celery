# Celery (level 7 exploit)
The new level 7 Roblox exploit that BYPASSES BYFRON using UWP-Microsoft Store measures. This is very powerful because Roblox currently has Byfron on their clients and they removed access of joining games in 32-bit.

Why you should use Celery - Lv. 7 Exploit
- Safe and reliable; it comes from the Microsoft Store!
- Powerful; bypasses Byfron by using non-Byfron libraries while not being on a expired client!
- Easy to use; no need all those Tampermonkey scripts and stuff like that!

# Operating Systems
Celery supports:

- Microsoft Windows 10 [Tested, unknown build] (with Microsoft Store; LTSC will need Windows Store installer helper)
- Microsoft Windows 11 [Tested, working 22H2] (with Microsoft Store; LTSC will need Windows Store installer helper)
