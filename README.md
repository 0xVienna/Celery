# Celery (level 7 exploit)
The new level 7 Roblox exploit that BYPASSES BYFRON using UWP-Microsoft Store measures. This is very powerful because Roblox currently has Byfron on their clients and they removed access of joining games in 32-bit.

Celery supports:

- Microsoft Windows 10 [Not tested] (with Microsoft Store; LTSC will need Windows Store installer helper)
- Microsoft Windows 11 [Tested, working 22H2] (with Microsoft Store; LTSC will need Windows Store installer helper)
